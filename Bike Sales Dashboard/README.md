# Bike Sales Dashboard

## Overview
The Bike Sales Dashboard provides a visual summary of bike purchase trends, segmented by various demographic and lifestyle factors. This dashboard was created using Excel and includes insights into how income, gender, age, and commute distance influence bike purchase behavior.

## Visualizations

### 1. 'Income' by 'Gender' and 'Purchased Bike'
This bar chart shows the distribution of income for individuals based on gender and whether they purchased a bike. Key insights include:
- The average income for females who purchased a bike is slightly lower than that for males.
- Males have a higher income on average, whether they purchased a bike or not.

### 2. 'Purchases' By 'Age'
This line chart illustrates bike purchases segmented by different age groups:
- **Adolescent**: Ages with relatively lower purchase rates.
- **Middle Age**: The highest bike purchase rates.
- **Old**: Purchase rates decline with age.
  
It highlights a peak in purchases within the middle-age demographic.

### 3. 'Purchases' By 'Commute Distance'
This line chart examines bike purchases in relation to commute distances:
- Individuals commuting between **0-1 Miles** show the highest purchase rate.
- Purchase rates decrease for those with longer commute distances, with some fluctuations between **2-5 Miles** and **5-10 Miles**.
  
## How to Use
This dashboard is useful for businesses or analysts interested in identifying target demographics for bike sales. By understanding trends based on gender, age, and commuting habits, marketing strategies can be tailored to maximize sales potential in key segments.

## Insights
1. **Income Influence**: Higher incomes appear correlated with bike purchases, especially among males.
2. **Age Factor**: Middle-aged individuals are the primary bike buyers.
3. **Commute Distance Impact**: Short commutes are more likely associated with bike purchases, which could suggest bikes are used for local travel rather than long distances.

## Future Improvements
- Add more demographic variables, such as education level or occupation, to deepen the analysis.
- Include a trend over time to observe seasonal or annual patterns in bike purchases.
- Develop interactive elements for real-time filtering by demographic segments.
